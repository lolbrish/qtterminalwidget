How To Try
==========
This archive does not include java byte code, so please compile
the source code by your self.  Suppose you have jsch-?.?.?.zip and 
jcterm-?.?.?.zip

First of all, please compile jsch.
  $ unzip jsch-?.?.?.zip
  $ cd jsch-?.?.?/src
  $ javac com/jcraft/jsch/*java com/jcraft/jsch/jce/*java \
          com/jcraft/jzlib/*.java

Then, please compile jcterm
  $ cd ../..
  $ unzip jcterm-?.?.?.zip
  $ cd jcterm-?.?.?/src
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../../jsch-?.?.?/src javac com/jcraft/jcterm/*.java

Ok, you can try it as follow,
  $ CLASSPATH=.:../../jsch-?.?.?/src java com.jcraft.jcterm.JCTerm

If you need the packet compression support, you have to put the jar file of 
jzlib(http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib) in the CLASSPATH.
